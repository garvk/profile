## Overview

**aggrag** is an authored framework for configuring, running, comparing, and deploying multiple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines in a unified experiment-to-production stack.

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **Active** - Open Source Framework

## Description

A comprehensive framework that simplifies the entire lifecycle of RAG systemsâ€”from experimentation to production deployment. It provides a unified interface for:
- Configuring multiple RAG & LLM pipeline variants
- Prompt experimentation
- Running experiments with different configurations
- Comparing performance across pipelines

## Key Features

### Configuration Management
- Interactive pipeline configuration
- Support for multiple RAG architectures
- Easy parameter tuning
- Version control friendly

### Experimentation
- Run multiple pipeline variants simultaneously
- A/B testing capabilities
- Performance benchmarking
- Metrics tracking and comparison

### Production Deployment
- Seamless experiment-to-production workflow
- Production-grade pipeline deployment
- Monitoring and observability
- Scalable architecture

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Vector databases
- LLM integrations
- Retrieval systems
- Evaluation frameworks


## Use Cases

- Building RAG-powered applications
- Comparing different retrieval strategies
- Optimizing RAG pipeline performance
