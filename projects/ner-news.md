# Named Entity Recognition from News Articles

## Overview

Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to measure improvement against traditional ML baseline models for Named Entity Recognition tasks such as extracting names, locations and organisations etc from texts. 

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **Done** - Research & Development

## Description

A research project exploring the application of modern LLM-based approaches to Named Entity Recognition (NER) in news articles. The project aims to compare and contrast the performance of LLM/RAG-based approaches against traditional machine learning baseline models.

## Objectives

- Evaluate LLM performance on NER tasks
- Implement RAG-enhanced NER systems
- Benchmark against traditional ML models
- Measure accuracy improvements
- Analyze cost-performance tradeoffs

## Key Components

### Traditional ML Baseline
- Established NER models
- Benchmark performance metrics
- Baseline accuracy measurements

### LLM/RAG Approach
- LLM-based entity extraction
- RAG for context enhancement
- Prompt engineering for NER tasks
- Few-shot learning techniques

## Technology Stack

- Large Language Models (GPT, Claude, etc.)
- RAG frameworks
- Traditional ML models (spaCy, BERT-based NER, etc.)
- News article datasets
- Evaluation metrics

## Research Questions

- How do LLMs compare to traditional NER models?
- What accuracy improvements can RAG provide?
- What are the cost-performance tradeoffs?
- When should LLMs be preferred over traditional approaches?
