                at the core of my work is the belief that <strong>academic research should not remain confined to ivory towers</strong>. 
                my mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications that empower communities and businesses.

                my journey began with a fundamental question: <strong>"why are we not employing actuarial skills outside insurance and pension?"</strong> 
                this questioning led to a complete career transformation and the exploration of new frontiers in technology, defi, and ai.

                technology evolves rapidly, and staying relevant means <strong>moving at the speed of technology</strong>.
