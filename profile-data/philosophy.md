# Philosophy & Approach

## Driving Beliefs

### Commercializing Academic Research
At the core of my work is the belief that **academic research should not remain confined to ivory towers**. My mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications that empower communities and businesses.

### Questioning the Status Quo
My journey began with a fundamental question: **"Why are we not employing actuarial skills outside insurance and pension?"** This questioning led to a complete career transformation and the exploration of new frontiers in technology, DeFi, and AI.

### Moving at the Speed of Technology
Technology evolves rapidly, and staying relevant means **moving at the speed of technology**. This philosophy drives continuous learning, rapid experimentation, and bold action.

## Work Approach

### Evidence-Driven Development
Every decision, every line of code, every system architecture is backed by evidence. From modeling pre-done use cases in aggrag to rigorous testing in DeFi protocols - **data and evidence guide the way forward**.

### Intellectually Stimulating Environment
Work should challenge the mind. Creating environments where **intellectual curiosity thrives** is not just a preference, it's a necessity for innovation.

### Customer Euphoria, Not Just Satisfaction
The goal isn't merely to satisfy clients - it's to **deliver beyond expectations**, to create moments of euphoria when solutions exceed what was thought possible.

## Learning Philosophy

### Self-Taught Excellence
From automobile engineering to actuarial science to coding to blockchain to AI - the journey demonstrates that **formal credentials matter less than relentless self-learning and practical application**.

The transition from knowing nothing about coding (2017) to selling $100K+ in algorithmic trading services (2019-2020) proves the power of:
- **Focused learning**
- **Practical application**
- **Market validation**
- **Iterative improvement**

### Teaching Through Doing
Enrolled and mentored 2 actuarial analysts who went on to bigger opportunities. The best way to solidify knowledge is to **teach others and watch them succeed**.

## Innovation Mindset

### Convergence of Disciplines
The most interesting work happens at the **intersection of different fields**:
- Actuarial science + Blockchain = DeFi risk frameworks
- Trading algorithms + Market inefficiencies = Profitable systems
- AI + Business intelligence = actionable insights

### Build, Validate, Scale
1. **Build** something that solves a real problem
2. **Validate** it with real users willing to pay
3. **Scale** it to reach more people

This was the pattern with algorithmic trading ($5K â†’ $100K), and it continues with every new venture.

### Embracing Failure as Learning
"Hired two engineers to help me, but that didn't work out" - failures are stepping stones. What matters is **learning from them and moving forward** with better understanding.

## What Inspires Me

### The Power of Technology to Democratize Access
Technology can level the playing field. Whether it's:
- Making trading strategies accessible to individuals
- Bringing institutional-grade risk analysis to DeFi protocols
- Using AI to help small business owners derive insights from their data

The goal is always to **empower people with tools that were previously accessible only to the elite**.

### Solving Complex Problems with Elegant Solutions
The beauty of mathematics, the elegance of well-written code, the satisfaction of a system that just works - these are the intrinsic motivators.

### Building Things That Outlast Me
From frameworks like aggrag to risk systems for Euler to AI platforms at Fractal - the focus is on creating **systems and tools that continue to provide value long after their creation**.

## Collaboration Philosophy

### Extreme Trust & Accountability
"Assume positive intent of others and hold each other accountable" - this isn't just a value, it's the foundation of every successful collaboration, from work with Ravjot Singh Anand on DeFi research to leading teams at Fractal.ai.

### Intellectual Honesty
Being honest about what we know, what we don't know, and what we need to learn. This creates an environment where **real innovation can happen**.

## The Bigger Picture

### From Insurance to DeFi to AI - The Common Thread
While the domains have changed, the underlying principle remains constant: **using quantitative methods, risk assessment, and systematic thinking to solve complex problems in novel ways**.

The mindset of understanding risk, modeling uncertainty, and making data-driven decisions translates perfectly to:
- Algorithmic trading (risk-reward optimization)
- DeFi protocols (systemic risk analysis)
- AI systems (probabilistic reasoning and decision-making)

### Building for the Future
Every project, every line of code, every system is built with an eye toward the future. Not just tomorrow, but years ahead. This long-term thinking ensures that **solutions remain relevant as technology evolves**.
