# My Journey

A personal narrative of transition from automobile engineering to actuarial science to technology and AI.

## The Beginning (2013)

Out of love for the syllabus, I started my actuarial journey after graduating as an automobile engineer in 2013.

## Foundation in Actuarial Science (2014-2017)

Between 2014 and 2017, I worked with **RSA actuarial services on their group capital practice**. I studied the first 8 technical subjects, CT series.

At this time, I really questioned why we are not employing actuarial skills outside insurance and pension, leading to a sabbatical year in March 2017.

## Self-Learning & Experimentation (2017-2018)

**March 2017 - October 2018:** Self taught how to code. **Built algorithmic trading bots for my own trading in crypto markets using google scripts, R, python, java.** Hired two engineers to help me, but that didn't work out as intended.

## Building the Foundation (2018-2019)

**October 2018 - May 2019:** **Laid the foundation of a full scale autonomous algorithmic trading system** with a mentor. This is when I joined WeWork.

## Validation & Scale (2019-2020)

**May 2019 onwards:** I **sold the trading system on Upwork for $5000, proving my software works, adds value and there are people who'd pay for it.** This then led to selling my services on Upwork with algo trading as my niche. **In less than two years, I sold $250,000+ worth of algo trading services.** All 5 star reviews. I practically bootstrapped the development of my trading system.

## Establishing Techmendous (2020-2023)

**May 2020 onwards:** I established a tech service company, **Techmendous**, to take on pioneering research and development initiative across different domains, including actuarial science practice areas. Over the years, Techmendous enrolled 2 actuarial analysts who have gone on to be placed in bigger companies and universities.

## Deep Dive into Decentralized Finance (2021-2023)

During this period, I also immersed myself in the DeFi ecosystem, applying my actuarial and quantitative skills to blockchain protocols:

### Euler Protocol (2021-2023)
- **Risk Management Consultant & Developer** for Euler Protocol, a DeFi lending platform
- Developed comprehensive **Euler Risk Framework** analyzing collateral risk, liquidity risk, oracle risk, and smart contract risk
- Built **Euler Scan** - Protocol monitoring tool for real-time health tracking
- Conducted **Cost of Attack Analysis** - Security research framework
- **Early Research Phase for EulerSwap** (Dec 2022 - May 2023) - Provided foundational research for AMM protocol design, which launched in June 2025

### Uniswap Research (2022)
- Created **UniswapV3 Offline Simulator** for protocol analysis and liquidity position modeling
- Developed **Cost of Attack Analysis** framework for DeFi security assessment


### FTSO Oracle Integration (2023)
- Implementation and integration work with **Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO)** system
- FTSO data provider implementation and oracle integration with smart contracts
- Price feed reliability analysis and data submission optimization

### Other DeFi Work
- **Balancer Protocol Simulations** (2022) - Pool dynamics and liquidity provision strategy analysis
- Continued algorithmic trading work in crypto markets through **Topgun Arbitrage** platform

This phase represented the convergence of my actuarial risk assessment skills with blockchain technology, creating innovative approaches to DeFi protocol security and optimization.

## Leading AI Innovation (2023-Present)

**July 2023:** I took on a role as **Lead Architect at Fractal.ai**, where I am leading the development of novel products using generative AI models such as GPT and others.

## The Philosophy Behind the Craft

I believe good work transcends outcomes — it's the quiet alignment of systems, aesthetics, and human intent.

My craft lies in building from first principles, shaping teams and tools that embody clarity and permanence. In a world chasing speed, I chase stillness — depth that compounds, elegance that endures.

*I approach work like an artist-engineer — designing elegant systems that make logic feel human and beauty feel inevitable.*
